The File Hierarchy Structure (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like OS. 

All files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices. Some of these only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.

Here is a general layout of core files:
