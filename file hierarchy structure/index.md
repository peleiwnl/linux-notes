The File Hierarchy Structure (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like OS. 

All files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices. Some of these only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.

Here is a general layout of core files:

<div style="position: relative; width: 720px;">
<img src="images/root-files-example.png" usemap="#linuxmap" style="width:100%;">

<map name="linuxmap">

<area shape="rect" coords="205,0,350,75"
href="obsidian://open?vault=Linux&file=file%20hierarchy%20structure/subfolders/bin.md" alt="/bin">



</map>
</div>
