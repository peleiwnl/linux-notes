## /usr:

Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.

- Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
- `/usr/bin` contains binary files for user programs. If you can't find a user binary under `/bin`, look under `/usr/bin`.
- `/usr/sbin` contains binary files for system administrators. If you can't find a system binary under `/sib`, look under `/usr/bin`.
- `/usr/lib` contains libraries for `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`
- `/usr/local` contains user's programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under `/usr/local/apache2`.
- `/usr/src` holds the Linux kernel sources, header-files and documentation.
