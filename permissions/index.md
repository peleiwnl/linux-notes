Linux file permissions are the foundation of the system's security model, defining who can read, write, or execute files and directories, ensuring only authorized users or processes can access sensitive data.

These can be modified using the [[chmod]] command.

## The Three Basic Permissions

Every file or directory has three types:
- [[read]] (r)
- [[write]] (w)
- [[execute]] (x)
