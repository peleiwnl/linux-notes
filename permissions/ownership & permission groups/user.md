## Understanding User Ownership and Permissions

Different users in the OS have ownership and permission to ensure files are secure and put restrictions on other users who can modify the contents of the files.

- Root User: A superuser who has access to all directories and files in our system, and can perform any operation.
- Regular User: Limited access to files and directories and can only modify files they own.
