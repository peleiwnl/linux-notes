## /home:

Every non-root user has a personal directory inside /home. For example, if your username is peleiwnl, your directory would be /home/peleiwnl. Each user can create, delete or modify files only in their own home directory, and cannot access other's home directories.

Home directories store users' personal files, containing saved files, personal settings, etc...
