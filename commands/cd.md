## Change Directory

Used to move between folders, and can be told exactly which folder you want to go to, or just use shortcuts to get around.
### Moving around nearby folder

Moving to a folder that is within one we're already in, we can just use its name, for instance:

```
cd [directory name]
```

```
cd Downloads
```
