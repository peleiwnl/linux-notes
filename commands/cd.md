## Change Directory

Used to move between folders, and can be told exactly which folder you want to go to, or just use shortcuts to get around.
### Moving around nearby folder

Moving to a folder that is within one we're already in, we can just use its name, for instance:

```
cd [directory name]
```

```
cd Downloads
```

### Going to a Specific Folder

We can go to a specific folder by providing the complete path to it. For example, if we want to access the downloads folder:

```
cd [directory path]
```

```
cd /home/username/documents
```
